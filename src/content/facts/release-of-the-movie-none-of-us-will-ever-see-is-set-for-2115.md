title: Release of the Movie None of Us Will Ever See Is Set for 2115
description: >-
  John Malkovich and Robert Rodriguez collaborated for a film that no one will
  see for 100 years. Literally.


  They have made a film, called 100 Years, which is being placed in a special
  time-locked safe that will not open again until November 2115. Why? Well, because it's promotion for Louis XIII Cognac, an ultra-luxury liquor that is aged 100 years. Bottles currently on shelves were made hundred years ago so they decided a piece of art that speaks to their commitment to quality was
  something worth doing.
