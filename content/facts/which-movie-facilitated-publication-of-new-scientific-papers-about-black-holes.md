  Which movie facilitated publication of new scientific papers about black
  holes?
description: >-
  Interstellar is the first Hollywood movie to attempt depicting a black hole as
  it would actually be seen by somebody nearby. For this, Kip Thorne, a
  theoretical physicist who served as scientific consultant generated equations
  that guided new CGI rendering software the way physics governs the real world.


  In the end, Christopher Nolan got elegant images that advance the story.
  Thorne got not only a movie that teaches a mass audience some real, accurate
  science, but also a scientific discovery that inspired him to publish new
  papers.
