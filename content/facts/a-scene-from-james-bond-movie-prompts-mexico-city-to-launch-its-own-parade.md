  A scene from James Bond movie prompts Mexico City to launch its own parade
description: >-
  Mexicans traditionally celebrate the Day of the Dead with a family picnic to
  remember their loved ones at graveyard or in front of a decorated shrine at
  home.


  However, in recent years the festival moved from private into the public eye,
  and since 2016 Mexico City holds annual costumed parades with cavalcade of
  giant skulls after they were inspired by a scene from the James Bond movie
  Spectre.
