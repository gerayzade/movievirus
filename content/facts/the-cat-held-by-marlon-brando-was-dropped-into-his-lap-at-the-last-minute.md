  The Cat Held by Marlon Brando Was Dropped Into His Lap at the Last Minute
description: >-
  The cat held by Marlon Brando in the opening scene was a stray Francis Ford Coppola found while on the lot at Paramount. The cat was not originally called for in the script, and the cat with its purring muffled some of Brando's dialogue, and, as a result, most of his lines had to be looped.
