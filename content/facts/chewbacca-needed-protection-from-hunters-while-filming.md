title: Chewbacca needed protection from hunters while filming
description: >-
  During the filming of Return of the Jedi, Peter Mayhew, the rather tall actor
  who has played Chewbacca had to be protected while in the forest in the fears
  that someone might confuse him for "Big Foot" and try to shoot him... A group
  of production assistants in brightly colored vests was assigned to go around
  with him to make sure people knew he wasn't a Sasquatch.
