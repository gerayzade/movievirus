title: Actor who played Luca Brasi was actually in the Mafia
description: >-
  Filming of Mario Puzo's classic novel The Godfather was met with resistance
  from the Italo-American League for Civil Rights, founded by real crime
  families. In result the word "mafia" was excluded from the script and also
  some mobsters were sent to observe the set. One of them was protected by
  bodyguard Lenny Montana, who was invited to the role of the hitman Luca Brasi,
  after the previously approved actor died of a stroke. Although Montana had no
  enough screen time, he attracted the attention of Hollywood producers and
  played gangster role in more than a dozen movies.
