title: Which movie contributed to the success of Apollo 13 rescue mission?
description: >-
  A Hollywood movie _Marooned_ depicts three astronauts who survive an accident
  in space, but their lives hang in the balance as the people in Mission Control
  at NASA work night and day to figure out a way to bring the spacefarers home
  safely. NASA engineer Jerry Woodfill had watched the film only a couple of
  hours before he was awakened by a phone call informing him that the Apollo 13
  spacecraft had suffered an accident. According to him, _Marooned_ was actually
  a catalyst to the rescue of Apollo 13.
