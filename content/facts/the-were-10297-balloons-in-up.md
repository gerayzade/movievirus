  There Were 10,297 Balloons in Up
description: >-
  The animators who created the pack of balloons in Up actually created every single one. The film's effects artist, Jon Reisch, told that, "The entire canopy is filled with balloons. We didn't just simulate the outer shell." And they even got a specific count of exactly the number of balloons: 10,297.
