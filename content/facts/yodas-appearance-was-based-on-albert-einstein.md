title: Yoda's Appearance Was Based on Albert Einstein
description: >-
  According to Mental Floss, the creator of Yoda — makeup supervisor and special
  effects artist Stuart Freeborn — was heavily influenced by a picture of
  Einstein which was hung on a wall in the office where Yoda’s physical
  appearance was being creatively molded. Consequently, he felt inspired to
  fashion the Jedi master's facial features, specifically his eyes and wrinkles,
  after Einstein.
