title: Toy Story 2 was almost fully erased in a matter of seconds
description: >-
  One simple command entered into a computer where the animation for Toy Story 2 was stored deleted 90% of the work the Pixar team had done on it. A plan was quickly hatched to restore the data from a regular backup, which meant that only half a day of work would have been lost. But the backup system had failed. Pixar, incredibly, did not have a copy of the Toy Story 2 files on its servers. Fortunately, the film's technical director had a copy she had been working on from home, and much of it was restored.
